Hinted: A Context-Inspired Word Guessing Game

Hinted is an interactive web-based word guessing game, inspired by the popular game Contexto. This project showcases a full-stack application developed using Django (Python) for the backend and React (JavaScript) for the frontend. The game leverages the Stanford GloVe model for natural language processing to analyze word similarities and provide context-based clues to players.

Key Features:

    Word similarity analysis using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation).
    User-friendly interface with responsive design for an engaging game experience.
    RESTful API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
    Dynamic word guessing logic that challenges and entertains players.

Technologies Used:

    Backend: Django, Python, GloVe model for NLP.
    Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    Database: MySQL for storing game data and player scores.
    Deployment: Configured on AWS with Gunicorn as the WSGI server.

Goals of the Project:

    To create an engaging and educational word game that tests players' vocabulary and contextual understanding.
    To demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development, from database management to frontend interactivity.
    To explore the integration of machine learning models in web applications.
